# Overview

As an aspiring Software Engineer, I have found it crucial to continue learning new
skills consistently and constantly. I also have realized how important it is to 
put a part of oneself into all they do.

In this simple HelloWorld project, I have demonstrated the simple ability to
display the classic phrase 'Hello World' to the screen. In doing so, I have added 
a bit of fun by adding typewriter sound effects as the message is displayed one 
letter at a time.

My purpose in this project is to give a simple welcome to my portfolio by 
demonstrating not only a language, but a bit of myself as well.
